# Captain Dash
*a 2D puzzle platformer, shoot 'em up and survival game!*

### About

You play a space captain named Dash, whose ship is about to be blown up by robot space pirates. 

You have to hurry to your escape pod, but there only way you will make it in time is if you use your rocket suit. Unfortunately, the suit has been damaged and the only thing still working is the rocket boots. The boots alone does not have enough power to keep boosting you, so you conserve enough power to escape the ship by only using the boots in short bursts.

Escaping in your pod, you are met in the cold space by asteroids, missile barrages and enemy intercepters. Luckily your escape pod has a blaster, though not very powerfull.
